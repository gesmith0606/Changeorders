This also includes the piping change of the fuel Oil Return line from the day tank to the fuel oil riser where the DOB inspectors instructed JRM at the latest site inspection 3/1/17 to run the return piping along the floor of the 6th floor to that riser so the return line is not above the vent line. This is reflected on AMA's latest drawing M-306 & M-503 dated 3/3/17. The first corrective work required the roofer to patch the roof around the new 4"" vent piping and reseal to maintain the warranty.
